
	THIS IS YOUR WORKPLACE :) ENJOY


This editor is basic and all feature are triggered by keyboard, mouse is rarely used.
Colors has used to highlight status.
(Actually I'm slightly colorblind, let me know if you find some anomalies)

Currently the windows has a fixed size.
(Fixed? What? Yes.. I know. But this is beta release, let me see how things go..)

Content is stored in a local text file named "YEAST.txt"

Press CTRL+h to show the list of available shortcuts.

The usual shortcuts for copy (CTRL+c), paste (CTRL+v), cut (CTRL+x) work here as well.

The example below is used for the tutorial.
Feel free to customize and re-organize thing based on your need and workflow.


============
LIST OF TASK  (all titles and decoration are not real separator, just text)
============
Task must be declared between characters "<" and ">", and always starting at beginning of the line.
A valid task is written in "bold" blu color.

This is ok:
<sample task A>

These are not:
<kind of half-task
kind of half-task>
	<almost ok> just remove TAB at beginning to make it cool

Sub-task are not a real element, I just list them (TAB is optional) to keep my todo list well organized.

<PROJECT A task tile>
	- Prepare doc before meeting
	- Issue analysis
	- Review design implementation
	- Coding modules AA, BB
	- Coding modules CC + test integration on sim yyy
	Do not use sim xxx (due to its limitation)
	- Update GANTT
	Book holidays before Friday, do not forget

Yeah, it looks fine but we can have statuses for a better eye-scan overview.
Just use these keywords: TODO, PROGRESS, WAIT, DONE between characters "[" and "]".
There are no restrictions where to put them, also inside other text as showed here:

		"just some random text [PROGRESS] to demonstrate the status box... "


<PROJECT B another title>
	[TODO] 		- Prepare doc before meeting
	[DONE] 		- Issue analysis
	[DONE] 		- Review design implementation
	[PROGRESS] 	- Coding modules AA, BB
	[WAIT] 		- Coding modules CC + test integration on sim yyy
	Do not use sim xxx (due to its limitation)
	[TODO] Update GANTT
	Book holidays before Friday, do not forget

When the cursor is inside a status box you can toogle between status via CTRL+t.
It's more quick than write all chars.

Important texts can be written in red color, just put the symbol: (!)
The text on the right section will be red. This works only on a single line.

	You want this note important  (!) this text is important ...

If you need something more "eye capturing":

	(!) THIS IS VERY
	(!) IMPORTANT
	(!) multiline note


Finally a good way to write things can be:

<PROJECT C title>
	[TODO] 		- Prepare doc before meeting
	[DONE] 		- Issue analysis
	[DONE] 		- Review design implementation
	[PROGRESS] 	- Coding modules AA, BB
	[WAIT] 		- Coding modules CC + test integration on sim yyy
				(!) Do not use sim xxx (due to its limitation)

	[TODO] Update GANTT

	(!) Book holidays before Friday, do not forget


....
....
If you want to add personale notes, quotes, whatever... Here is a great place to put them.
Use any kind of decorator or separator.

				      !!!!!
				      |O O|
				---o0o--U--o0o---
....
....


===========================================================
TIMESHEET SECTION ... Where numbers change automatically :D
===========================================================
This is where the time spent on the tasks above is stored.
Each line state clearly all information.
When a task is already listed (for current date) then the minutes are updated, otherwise it is added at the end.

To start recording just move text cursor on the desired task and press CTRL+r
To stop recording press again CTRL+r (cursor can be anywhere outside a task)

Minimun granularity is minutes.

Records are currently not ordered! You can re-arrange them as you desired but please keep this format.

(!) VERY IMPORTANT TIP: do not write anything important below this section... (!)

2025-01-02		24		<sample task A>
2025-01-03		8		<previous task> maybe now it's deleted from your above list, but records still stay here
2025-01-04		8		<another previous task> 
2025-01-05		6		<random task>
2025-01-05		999		<do some stuff>
2025-01-06		2		<sample task A>
2025-01-06		5		<sample task B>
2025-01-06		2		<sample task C>
2025-01-06		7		<PROJECT A task tile> hey, you can add some notes if you want
							- and also add some indented notes...
							(!) but be aware that some record can be automatically added below...
2025-01-06		8		<PROJECT B another title>
